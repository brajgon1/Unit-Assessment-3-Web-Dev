    <h3 class="history">Brief History of Me</h3>
    <p class="para">I was the fifth born in a ever-growing family in a small town called Aumsville, Oregon. It's a small farm town about 15 minutes east of the capital Salem. I grew up playing sports. I went to three elementaries schools when I was young and three different small farmtown cities. Cascade High School was where I graduated from. I attended community college at Chemeketa and worked as a waiter and a bartender to pay off school.</p>
    <p class="para">My father accepted a job  out in Utah. This had me deciding where or not I needed to move out to Utah or remain in Oregon. I decided that I needed a fresh new start on life and packed up my 2005 Dodge Neon and drove all the way to Utah. I lived in Provo while I attended Utah Valley University. After securing a bachelors degree, I moved to Vineyard in the spring of 2019. I lived there through Covid, and eventually purchased a condo in American Fork in late 2021. My wife and I then moved to South Jordan April 2023 and have been here since</p>
